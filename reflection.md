What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think that just trying things and seeing what worked was helpful to work through the hw. I also think that the video was really helpful for getting started, my biggest advice would give is to plan out and really outline what the instructions are asking from you. When planning out and getting a good outline it was much easier to breakdown what code was needed to make whatever I wanted to do happen. There were many things that didn't end up working and reading the error messages and also being careful about variables and keeping track because many of my mistakes were from misspelling or mislabeling arguments.
